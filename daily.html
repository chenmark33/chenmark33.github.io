 				<p><strong> Response to <a href="https://databricks.com/blog/2018/01/13/meltdown-and-spectre-performance-impact-on-big-data-workloads-in-the-cloud.html"> Article 1: </a> </strong></p>
 				<p> This article discusses the impact that two vulnerability patches can have on database performance. One important feature of various databases is their performance. Part of it is dependent on the hardware being utilized, such as the storage hardware or processor, and another part of it may depend on the structure and design of the database itself. Various web services and processes that utilize databases in their operation, such as e-mail services, banks, and content providers, all depend on consistent operation from these databases. Big data applications are very resource intensive. The Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities both impact parts of the processor that "perform function calls and context switches", which are responsible for a large part of the CPU's performance. </p> 
 				<p> Although this article is mostly about specific performance impacts on cloud databases, it brings up the important issue of maintaining a balance between security demands and optimal performance. Vulnerabilities like these that engineers may or may not have been aware of can directly lead to performance degradation when eventually patched in not just databases, but also anything else that relies on high performance computing. Patches that do lead to degraded performance can cost IT budgets millions of dollars when revenue/profit loss due to poor performance is accounted for. I believe the article also highlights how important it is for database developers to take into account any unexpected vulnerabilities that could come up without warning.</p>

 				<p><strong> Response to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/politics/ice-license-plate-readers/index.html"> Article 2: </a> </strong></p>
 				<p> This article discusses how US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has recently acquired a contract to have access to a database of national license plates. The primary purpose would most likely be for the tracking of vehicles that could belong to or be used by illegal aliens or immigrants. The article mentions how the agency had already attempted to acquire a contract for access to a national license plate database but cancelled it due to privacy issues, back in 2014. </p> 
 				<p> I think this article beings up an important issue of responsible database use. More often than not, databases are often used for reference or look-up data, but as surveillance and privacy becomes an ever-increasing concern in a more digital age, more and more agencies and companies are looking to take advantage of databases for their own purposes. I believe that while enforcing the law is an important task, the methods that are used to do so should be carefully scrutinized. It's very easy to set a precedent for further privary concerns or overreach </p>
